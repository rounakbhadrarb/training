7. we have seen what insert does. Try out and find what upsert does?
Ans:
Upsert is a combination of update and insert. Upsert performs two functions:
1.Update data if there is a matching document.
2.Insert a new document in case there is no document matches the query criteria.

>db.customer.update({first_name:"hi"},{first_name:"hiii",last_name:"hello",gender:"male"},{upsert:true});

8. what happens when you use'upsert:true' with update statement?

>db.customer.update({first_name:"hi"},{first_name:"hiii",last_name:"hello",gender:"male"},{upsert:true});
